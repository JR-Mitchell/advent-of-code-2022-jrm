## Notes on the challenge
It's been a long day, so I'm not going to try to be particularly optimal.
I'm just going to use OOP to find a valid solution.

My solution is definitely imperfect.
But, it gives the correct answer - and that's what counts, right?

### Part 2
This should be easy enough with what I've already put in place.

Words typed too soon, I got an incorrect answer (despite the test passing)...
